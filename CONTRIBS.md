# Contribution Policy
If you've got something to add, feel free to open a pull request. Likewise, if you've got a bug needs fixing or a feature to suggest, open 
an issue. You know how this works. If your PR works, I'll finish the merge, if it doesn't, I'll discuss it with you so we can hopefully 
merge it.

## Licencing
This project is true FOSS. It's property of the commons of the wider Arduino community. Australian law (where I live) means I retain a moral 
right in all work I create, so the licence is a modified MIT. It allows me (and anybody else who contribs) to profit off profiteers. If 
somebody does negotiate a licence for theis code, it'll be in the form of sponsoring this repo. (You know to hire real coders for code 
poetry, engineers to designe a custom circuit board and support circuitry, technical writers to document the gadget properly, that sort of 
thing. Or just a basic subscription level GitHub membership.)

## Administration
Ongoing contribs with 10 or more successful contributions in the past 12 months get maintainer privileges and the power to merge their own 
PRs. If it goes to your head, you might be warned. If you let it go to your head again, you might be dropped back to contrib level.

If this project advances to becoming a community, decision making will be by negotiated consensus. Consensus means we all find a way to 
agree with a proposal or we all try to negotiate changes to gain full consensus or we drop the proposal because consesnsus can't be reached. 
As lead maintainer, I will have the cast on matters where consensus cannot be reached but, this will only come down to choosing the least 
disruptive path forward, in the spirit and best interests of the community, such as splitting a proposal to what can be agreed, and what 
can't, if that is a feasible option.

If it contiues to stay as just li'l ol' me, so be it, but if you think you have something to contribute, don't be shy and don't be greedy, 
either.

&hearts; Crunchy.
